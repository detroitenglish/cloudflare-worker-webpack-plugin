# Configuration

## Authorization

* `$CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_EMAIL`: Your Cloudflare user email.
* `$CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_KEY`: Your Cloudflare super-duper-secret API key.


## Deployment Config

* `zone`: required - the ID of the zone/domain/website for which you're deploying your script
* `pattern`: optional - a route matching pattern, a comma-separated list of patterns, or an Array of patterns to enable for your newly spawned JavaScript minion (default: `undefined`)
  - Example (string): `"*.your-site.lol/crazy/*/pattern"`
  - Example (list): `"*.your-site.lol/crazy/*/pattern,your-site.lol/another/*/crazy/*/pattern"`
  - Example (Array): `["*.your-site.lol/crazy/*/pattern", "your-site.lol/another/*/crazy/*/pattern"]`
* `script`: optional - **relative** path to your worker script (default: `<webpack-config output file>`)
* `clearRoutes`: Delete ALL existing route patterns; requires a `pattern` string be provided (default: `false`)
* `skipWorkerUpload`: Skip uploading the worker script and process only route patterns (default: `false`)
* `verbose`: Log additional information about each deployment step to the console (default: `false`)
* `enabled`: Whether to deploy to Cloudflare or bypass; useful for e.g. CI and testing (default: `true`)

**Note**: If you provide 1 or more matching patterns, any currently enabled matching patterns will be disabled if they are not included in the `pattern` option.


# Potential Issues

This plugin does not support features reserved for Enterprise Cloudflare Workers.


# Contributing

PR's are very much welcome. Here are some fun ideas to consider:

- [ ] Write hella' cool automated tests
- [ ] Replace `axios` dependency with Node's native `http.get`
- [ ] Help convince Cloudflare that '_Edge Gremlins_' is a **waaaay** cooler name

Feel free to create an issue throwing your own ideas at me.
